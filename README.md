# An Investigation into the Heart Dataset
This repository includes code and dataset necessary to complete the UCD PA course. Repository started on 10th March 2023.
### 1. Intended Use

The aim of this report is to take an investigation into the heart dataset. By examining the variables within the data-set, we aim to discover the influencing factors on heart disease. This report will examine that relationship between independent variables and heart disease.

### 2. Installation

Python is a high level general purpose programming language. In order to conduct our analysis we used Python in order to examine the heart data, conduct charts and summary statistics and derive meaningful insights from the data. A full step by step guide on downloading Python and how to use it is shown below.

* Anaconda is a distributor of Python. In order to run a Python notebook we must first download Anaconda. With it we can open a Jupyter notebook and commence analysis.
* To download and run Jupyter search Anaconda on your web-browser or click the link below to be guided to the website

https://www.anaconda.com/

* Once on the Anaconda homepage you click the download button below- I am on a windows computer so i am downloading Anaconda for Windows.

* Go to your Downloads folder and double-click the installer to launch
* Click Next.
* Read the licensing terms and click I Agree.
* It is recommendeded that you install for Just Me, which will install Anaconda Distribution to just the current user account.
* Click Next.
* Select a destination folder to install Anaconda and click Next. I installed it on my personal folder set up on my Windows laptop which is also my work laptop (I didn't need to get any extra permissions to download unlike some other downloads) **Do not install as Administrator unless admin privileges are required.

* Click Install. If you want to watch the packages Anaconda is installing, click Show Details.
* Click Next.
* Once sucessfully installed  you will get ‚ÄúThanks for installing Anaconda‚Äù dialogue box- then press Finish and the download is complete.
* In order to launch Anaconda, search for the application in the search bar of your computer and open.
### 3. Data üìä üìà
* The user can choose to download the files directly from specific data set websites. I chose Kaggle for mine. https://www.kaggle.com/
Kaggle is free but you need to register to avail of the datasets.
Kaggle offers aggregated datasets, but it‚Äôs a community hub rather than a search engine. Kaggle launched in 2010 with a number of machine learning competitions, which subsequently solved problems for the likes of NASA and Ford. It has since evolved into a renowned open data platform, offering cloud-based collaboration for data scientists, as well as educational tools for teaching artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques‚Ä¶plus, of course, tonnes of great datasets covering almost any topic you can imagine.

I chose Heart failure prediction dataset for mine ‚ù§üë©üë®üíäüöë
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction
* Once I downloaded the dataset I set up a Data Folder in my downloads where i store everything that i need to open in my Jupyter Notebook in my Anaconda Navigator. This is the same folder where we will store the Jupyter notebook. 

**Please ensure you download the jupyter notebook and dataset in the same folder. This will ensure you do not need to set a path to the data**

### 4. Running the notebook üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üñ•Ô∏è 

#### Downloading and opening the notebook

* We launch Jupyter notebook. Once anaconda is opened, find the jupyter launch tool.

* Once launched, you should get the general launch page in your web browser

* Follow the path to the folder where you have stored the data and downloaded my jupyter notebook. I have stored the data and notebook in a folder called Data on my desktop.

* Within the containing folder, open the notebook containing all code. It should be stored under the same file name you see below.

* Once the notebook has been opened, we can run all sections of the notebook as one by clicking the 'fastforward' icon displayed on the top tab below.

* You can also choose to run cell by cell by hitting SHIFT and ENTER at the same time on your keyboard. This notebook has been embedded with text in order to provide the reader with clarity when running the notebook.

## Sections of the notebook üî¢

The notebook is organised into seven sections  
1. Data
2. Importing
3. Preparation
4. Analysis
5. Visualisation
6. Insights
7. Machine Learning
