# An Investigation into the Heart Dataset
This repository includes code and dataset necessary to complete the UCD PA course. Repository started on 10th March 2023.
### 1. Intended Use


### 2. Installation

Python is a high level general purpose programming language .In order to conduct our analysis we used Python in order to examine the heart data, conduct charts and summary statistics and derive meaningful insights from the data. A full step by step guide on downloading Python and how to use it is shown below.

* Anaconda is a distributor of Python. In order to run a Python notebook we must first download Anaconda. With it we can open a Jupyter notebook and commence analysis.
* Search Anaconda on your web-browser or click the link below to be guided to the website

https://www.anaconda.com/

* Once on the Anaconda homepage you click the download button below- I am on a windows computer so i am downloading Anaconda for Windows.

### 3. Data 📊 📈
* The user can choose to download the files directly from specific data set websites. I chose Kaggle for mine. https://www.kaggle.com/
Kaggle is free but you need to register to avail of the datasets.
Kaggle offers aggregated datasets, but it’s a community hub rather than a search engine. Kaggle launched in 2010 with a number of machine learning competitions, which subsequently solved problems for the likes of NASA and Ford. It has since evolved into a renowned open data platform, offering cloud-based collaboration for data scientists, as well as educational tools for teaching artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques…plus, of course, tonnes of great datasets covering almost any topic you can imagine.

* Once i downloaded the dataset i set up a Data Folder in my downloads where i store everything that i need to open in my Jupyter Notebook in my Anaconda Navigator.

### 4. Running the notebook 🏃‍♀️ 🖥️ 

#### Downloading and opening the notebook
I chose Jupyter notebook 
Please see the image below, once launched i then was able to access my data folder mentioned above.
